How do you manage changes in your project? Developers tends to hate changes in the requirements of their software. On the contrary, usually if a software change its behavior it's because someone it's actually using it. So an healthy software is a software that is living in a continous evolving scenario.

Is your software ready for the continous changes? In other words is your software resilient to changes?

## Introducing Architectural Clash

In extrategy we developed a new way to assess the level of resilience of our frontend and mobile applications: the  Architectural Clash.

### Why

Let's [start with why](https://www.startwithwhy.com/). Why should I care about the resilience of my codebase? You should care because changes are inevitable in real life applications. So you need to know how your software react to chenges. Your software should tend to be [Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile).

### When

When I should care? Obviously your project should have a medium lifespan at least. If you're creating a mobile app for a new startup you don't know how your business is going to last. So in that case the best thing to do is to write the code as fast as you can, test the market, and then [throw away everything](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/SacrificialArchitecture.html) and start anew. But if you have a consolidated business and your software should last for years or decades, Architectural Clash it's the right tool for you.
